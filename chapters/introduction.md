# introduction

Whenever I consider writing about my experiece or perspective, I'm remember an old Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal comic, https://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/2014-02-13. In which a person is burdened by a rock that's lodged itself in the the person's head. It (the person) is tormented by the rock. It tries to find meaning in the pain, but can't. One day the rock comes loose, and the person decided that "whatever it had done before the stone disloged was the source of happiness." It then proceeded to tell everyone the path to happiness. But other's couldn't find its happiness, because they didn't have a stone in their head.

I am a middle aged, trans-fem, bipolar, anxious, system. These are the relevant constraints of this book.
